In this chapter, we present the details of two separate studies carried out using the framework. First, we detail our attempts at reproducing five recent approaches in the field of TSA, and any challenges faced therein. Following this, we consider the top-performing model from the reproduction experiments and use the framework to investigate the potential benefits of different strategies for handling OOV tokens..
