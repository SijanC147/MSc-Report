We have discussed  the design principles that were considered at each sub-component of the framework, on a conceptual level, to address the objectives described in \S\ref{sec:objectives}. Furthermore, we have presented how each of these sub-components assemble to establish a framework which simplifies the process of implementing new TSA models and provides a static evaluation environment with robust metrics and informative visualizations, illustrated in chapter \ref{chap:evaluation_methods}. First, however, chapter \ref{chap:implementation} shall expound on how the design principles outlined herein were actualized into code at  particular stages of the framework.
